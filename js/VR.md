// NAMING OF FILES//
HelloWorldScene is the landing scene - at the moment this is the beach
Hoping to either add Sumerian or have a video which some description as to what needs to be done

// HOW TO ADD PORTALS //
When linking to another scene, a portal has been used (same as AR, except ambientlight needs to be added to get it appear!)
An onFuse method can be applied to allow for the users gaze to be on the image for a set time before being transported to next scene
Functions such as sceneOne push the VR to the next scene - links to file name of the next scene
Time to fuse - in milliseconds

// USING STATE & CONDITIONAL RENDERING//
In scene one, state set to show different text
Conditional rendering used to show down icon for more text & after this disappears

// BILLBOARD//
Transform properties billboard used so that the object always appears in front of you

// STYLESHEETS//
Can create stylesheets in similar fashion as the example one
